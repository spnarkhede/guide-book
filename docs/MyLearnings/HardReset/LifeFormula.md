# Life Formula - Keys to Success

**Happiness** = *Health + Wealth + Good Relationships*
- This equation suggests that happiness is a combination of these three key factors. A healthy lifestyle, financial security, and strong relationships contribute significantly to a person's overall well-being.

**Health** = *Exercise + Diet + Sleep*
-  This formula emphasizes the importance of these three pillars for good health.

**Exercise** = *High Intensity Resistance Training + Sports + Rest*
- This breakdown suggests a well-rounded approach to exercise that includes building muscle (resistance training), cardiovascular activity (sports), and allowing for recovery (rest).

**Diet** = *Natural Foods + Intermittent Fasting + Plants*
- This breakdown highlights the importance of consuming unprocessed foods, incorporating intermittent fasting (potentially), and focusing on plant-based options for a healthy diet.

**Sleep** = *No alarms + 8-9 hours + Circadian rhythms*
- This points towards prioritizing quality sleep without relying on alarms, aiming for 8-9 hours per night, and aligning sleep patterns with your natural body clock (circadian rhythms).

**Wealth** = *Income + Wealth * (Return on Investment)*
- This formula demonstrates the concept of wealth accumulation. Wealth is a combination of your income and how effectively you invest that income for growth (represented by Return on Investment).

**Income** = *Accountability + Leverage + Specific Knowledge*
- This breakdown highlights the importance of personal branding, utilizing resources or skills to increase earning potential (leverage), and developing valuable skills that society needs (specific knowledge) to boost your income.

**Accountability** = *Personal Branding + Personal Platform + Taking Risk*
- This points towards actively managing your reputation (personal branding), utilizing platforms to present your skills (personal platform), and taking calculated risks to advance your income potential.

**Leverage** = *Capital + People + Intellectual Property*
- This breakdown suggests using existing financial resources (capital), collaborating with others (people), and leveraging unique skills or knowledge (intellectual property) to maximize your earning potential.

**Specific Knowledge** = *Knowing how to do something society cannot yet easily train other people to do*
- This emphasizes the value of developing skills that are in high demand and difficult to replicate quickly.

**Return on Investment** = *"Buy-and-Hold" + Valuation + Margin of Safety*
- This simplifies ROI as a combination of a long-term investment strategy ("Buy-and-Hold"), focusing on undervalued assets (valuation), and ensuring a buffer for potential fluctuations (margin of safety).
